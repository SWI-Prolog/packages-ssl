\begin{abstract}
This document describes the SWI-Prolog SSL library, a set of predicates
which provides secure sockets to Prolog applications, for example to run
a secure HTTPS server, or access websites using the \const{https}
protocol.  It can also be used to provide authentication and secure
data exchange between Prolog processes over the network.

\section{Introduction}

Raw TCP/IP networking is dangerous for two reasons.  It is hard to tell
whether the body you think you are talking to is indeed the right one and
anyone with access to a subnet through which your data flows can `tap'
the wire and listen for sensitive information such as passwords,
creditcard numbers, etc.   Secure Socket Layer (SSL) deals with both
problems.  It uses certificates to establish the identity of the peer
and encryption to make it useless to tap into the wire.  SSL allows
agents to talk in private and create secure web services.

The SWI-Prolog \pllib{ssl} library provides an API very similar to
\pllib{socket} for raw TCP/IP connections that provides SSL server
and client sockets.


\section{About SSL}

The SWI-Prolog SSL interface is built on top of the
\url[OpenSSL]{http://www.openssl.org/} library. This library is commonly
provided as a standard package in many Linux distributions. The
MS-Windows version is built using a binary distribution available from
\url{http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html}.

A good introduction on key- and certificate handling for OpenSSL can be
found at \url{http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SSL-Certificates-HOWTO/}


\section{Overview of the Prolog API}

An SSL server and client can be built with the following (abstracted)
predicate calls:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline 
    SSL server    &     SSL client \\
\hline 
    ssl_init/3    &     ssl_init/3 \\
    ssl_accept/3  &     \\
    ssl_open/4    &     ssl_open/3 \\
    \ldots        &     \ldots \\
    ssl_exit/1      &   ssl_exit/1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

What follows is a description of each of these functions and the
arguments they accept.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{ssl_init}{3}{-SSL, +Server, +Options}
Server with legal values \const{server} or \const{client} denotes
whether the SSL socket will have a server or client role in the
established connection. With \arg{Options} various properties of the
TCP/IP + SSL connection can be defined, some of which required, some
optional. An overview is given below. The handle of the connection is
returned in \arg{SSL}.

Below is an overview of the \arg{Options} argument.  Some options are only
required by the client (C), some are required by the server (marked S),
some by both server as client (marked CS). 

\begin{description}
    \termitem{host}{+HostName} [C]
        The host to connect to by the client or identified by the server.
        Both IP addresses and hostnames can be supplied here. This option
        is required for the client and optionally for the server.
    \termitem{port}{+Integer} [CS]
        The port to connect or listen to. This option is required since
        no default port can sensibly be defined for an abstract layer.
	The webserver \jargon{https} protocol uses port 443.
    \termitem{certificate_file}{+FileName} [S]
        Specify where the certificate file can be found. This can be the
        same as the key file (see next option).
    \termitem{key_file}{+FileName} [S]
        Specify where the private key can be found. This can be the same
        as the certificate file.
    \termitem{password}{+Text}
        Specify the password the private key is protected with (if any).
	If you do not want to store the password you can also specify
	an application defined handler to return the password
	(see next option).
    \termitem{pem_password_hook}{:PredicateName}
        In case a password is required to access the private key the
        supplied function will be called to fetch it. The function
        has the following prototype: \term{function}{+SSL, -Password}
    \termitem{cacert_file}{+FileName}
        Specify a file containing certificate keys which will thus
        automatically be verified as trusted. You can also install
        an application defined handler to verify certificates (see
        next option).
    \termitem{cert_verify_hook}{:PredicateName}
        In case a certificate cannot be verified or has some properties
        which makes it invalid (invalid validity date for example) the
        supplied function will be called to ask its opinion about the
        certificate. The predicate is called as follows:
	\term{function}{+SSL, +Certificate, +Error}.  Access will be
	granted iff the predicate succeeds.
    \termitem{cert}{+Boolean}
        Trigger the sending of our certificate as specified using
        the option \const{certificate_file} described earlier. For a
        server this option is automatically turned on.
    \termitem{peer_cert}{+Boolean}
        Trigger the request of our peer's certificate while establishing
        the SSL layer. This option is automatically turned on in a client
	SSL socket.
\end{description}

    \predicate{ssl_accept}{3}{+SSL, -Socket, -Peer} 
This predicate is used in the server to accept new connections.
\arg{Socket} is unified to a socket that must be passed to ssl_open/4
and \arg{Peer} is unified with a term \functor{ip}{4} denoting the IP
address of the peer. The format is compatible to the format used by the
TCP/IP library \file{socket.pl} provided by the clib package.

    \predicate{ssl_open}{4}{+SSL, +Socket, -In, -Out}
Server side.  Attach a Prolog input and output stream to the socket. The
\arg{Socket} is automatically closed after both streams are closed.
Please note that the output stream is fully buffered and therefore
flush_output/1 is required to actually send the data to the peer.

    \predicate{ssl_open}{3}{+SSL, -In, -Out}
Client side. Establish the connection based on the data passed to
ssl_init/3 and create the Prolog I/O streams.

    \predicate{ssl_exit}{1}{+SSL}
Clean up all resources related to the SSL + TCP/IP socket layers.
\end{description}


\section{Using SSL to provide HTTPS}

This packages installs the library \pllib{http/http_ssl_plugin.pl}
alongside the http package. This library is a plugin for
\pllib{http/thread_httpd.pl} that makes the threaded HTTP server support
HTTPS, which is simply HTTP over an SSL socket.  The HTTP server is
started in HTTPS mode by adding an option \const{ssl} to http_server/2.
The argument of the \const{ssl} option is an option list passed to
ssl_init/3. Here is an example that uses the demo certificates
distributed with the SSL package.

\begin{code}
https_server(Port, Options) :-
        http_server(reply,
                    [ port(Port),
                      timeout(60),
                      ssl([ host('localhost'),
                            cacert_file('etc/demoCA/cacert.pem'),
                            certificate_file('etc/server/server-cert.pem'),
                            key_file('etc/server/server-key.pem'),
                            password('apenoot1')
                          ])
                    | Options
                    ]).
\end{code}


\section{Example code}
\label{sec:examples}

Examples of a simple server and client (\file{server.pl} and
\file{client.pl} as well as a simple HTTPS server (\file{https.pl}) can
be found in the example directory which is located in
\file{doc/packages/examples/ssl} relative to the SWI-Prolog installation
directory. The \file{etc} directory contains example certificate files
as well as a \file{README} on the creation of certificates using OpenSSL
tools.


\section{Installation}

The OpenSSL libraries are \emph{not} part of the SWI-Prolog distribution
and on systems using packagers with dependency checking, dependency on
OpenSSL is deliberatly avoided. This implies that OpenSSL must be
installed seperatly before using SSL with a binary distribution of
SWI-Prolog. Most modern Linux distributions have an SSL package. An
installer for MS-Windows is available from
\url{http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html} The SWI-Prolog
SSL interface is currently built using OpenSSL 0.97b.

When installing from the source, the package configuration 
automatically builds the ssl library if a suitable OpenSSL
implementation is found.  On Windows systems, OpenSSL must be
installed prior to building SWI-Prolog and \file{rules.mk} must
be edited to reflect the position of the header and libraries if
they are not in the standard search path.
