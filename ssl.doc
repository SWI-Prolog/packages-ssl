\begin{abstract}
This document describes the SWI-Prolog SSL library, a set of predicates
which provides secure sockets to Prolog applications, for example to run
a secure HTTP (HTTPS) server, or access websites using the \const{https}
protocol. It can also be used to provide authentication and secure data
exchange between Prolog processes over the network.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:ssl-intro}

Raw TCP/IP networking is dangerous for two reasons.  It is hard to tell
whether the body you think you are talking to is indeed the right one and
anyone with access to a subnet through which your data flows can `tap'
the wire and listen for sensitive information such as passwords,
creditcard numbers, etc.   Secure Socket Layer (SSL) deals with both
problems.  It uses certificates to establish the identity of the peer
and encryption to make it useless to tap into the wire.  SSL allows
agents to talk in private and create secure web services.

The SWI-Prolog \pllib{ssl} library provides an API to turn arbitrary
Prolog stream into SSL powered encrypted streams.

Cryptography is a difficult topic. If you just want to download
documents from an HTTPS server without worrying much about security,
http_open/3 will do the job for you. As soon as you have higher security
demands we strongly recomment you to read enough background material to
understand what you are doing. See \secref{ssl-security} for some
remarks regarding this implementation. This \url[The Linux Documentation
Project
page]{http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SSL-Certificates-HOWTO/index.html}
provides some additional background and tips for managing certificates
and keys.

\subsection{SSL Security}
\label{sec:ssl-security}

Using SSL (in this particular case based on the OpenSSL implementation)
to connect to SSL services (e.g., an \verb$https://$ address) easily
gives a false sense of security. This section explains some of the
pitfalls.\footnote{We do not claim to be complete, just to start warning
you if security is important to you. Please make sure you
understand (Open)SSL before relying on it.}. As stated in the
introduction, SSL aims at solving two issues: tapping information from
the wire by means of encryption and make sure that you are talking to
the right address.

Encryption is generally well arranged as long as you ensure that the
underlying SSL library has all known security patches installed and you
use an encryption that is not known to be weak. The Windows version of
SWI-Prolog ships with its own binary of the OpenSSL library. Ensure this
is up-to-date. Most other systems ship with the OpenSSL library and
SWI-Prolog uses the system version. This applies for the binaries we
distribute for MacOSX and Linux, as well as official Linux packages.
Check the origin and version of the OpenSSL libraries if SWI-Prolog was
compiled from source.

Whether you are talking to the right address is a complicated issue. The
core of the validation is that the server provides a
\jargon{certificate} that identifies the server. This certificate is
digitally \jargon{signed} by another certificate, and ultimately by a
\jargon{root certificate}.  Verifying the peer implies:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Verifying the chain or digital signatures until a trusted
    root certificate is found.
    \item Verifying that the signer of a certificate did not \jargon{revoke}
    the signed certificate.
    \item Verifying that the host we connected to is indeed the host
    claimed in the certificate.
\end{enumerate}

The default https client plugin (\pllib{http/http_ssl_plugin}) registers
the system trusted root certificate with OpenSSL. This is achieved using
the option \term{cacert_file}{system(root_certificates)} of
ssl_context/3. The verification is left to OpenSSL. To the best of our
knowledge, the current (1.0) version of OpenSSL \textbf{only} implements
step (1) of the verification process outlined above. This implies that
an attacker that can control DNS mapping (host name to IP) or routing
(IP to physical machine) can fake to be a secure host as long as they
manage to obtain a certificate that is signed from a recognised
authority.   The predicate ssl_peer_certificate/2 can be used to obtain
the peer certificate and inspect its properties.


\subsubsection{Disabling certificate checking}
\label{sec:disable-certificate}

In some cases clients are not really interested in host validation of
the peer and whether or not the certificate can be trusted.  In these
cases the client can pass \term{cert_verify_hook}{cert_accept_any},
calling cert_accept_any/5 which accepts any certificate.


\subsubsection{Establishing a safe connection}
\label{sec:ssl-safe-connection}

Applications that exchange sensitive data with e.g., a backend server
typically need to ensure they have a secure connection to their peer.

TODO: How to deal with this?


\section{Example code}
\label{sec:ssl-examples}

Examples of a simple server and client (\file{server.pl} and
\file{client.pl} as well as a simple HTTPS server (\file{https.pl}) can
be found in the example directory which is located in
\file{doc/packages/examples/ssl} relative to the SWI-Prolog installation
directory. The \file{etc} directory contains example certificate files
as well as a \file{README} on the creation of certificates using OpenSSL
tools.

\subsection{Accessing an HTTPS server}
\label{sec:ssl-https-client}

Accessing an \verb$https://$ server can be achieved using the code
skeleton below. The line \verb$:- use_module(library(http/http_ssl_plugin)).$
can be omitted if the development environment is present because the
plugin is dynamically loaded by http_open/3 of the \const{https} scheme
is detected.  See \secref{ssl-security} for more information about
security aspects.

\begin{code}
:- use_module(library(http/http_open)).
:- use_module(library(http/http_ssl_plugin)).

    ...,
    http_open(HTTPS_url, In, []),
    ...
\end{code}


\subsection{Creating an HTTPS server}
\label{sec:ssl-https-server}

The HTTP server is started in HTTPS mode by adding an option \const{ssl}
to http_server/2. The argument of the \const{ssl} option is an option
list passed to ssl_context/3.  Note that a server requires two items:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The \jargon{server certificate} identifies the server and
	  acts as a \jargon{public key} for the encryption.
    \item The \jargon{server key} provides the matching \jargon{private key}
	  and must be kept secret. It key \textit{may} be protected by a
	  password. If this is the case, the server must provide the
	  password by means of the \const{password} option or the
	  \const{pem_password_hook} callback.
    \end{enumerate}

Below is an example that uses the self-signed demo certificates
distributed with the SSL package. This version does not require a
certificate from the client, which is the normal case for publically
accessible HTTPS servers. The example file \file{https.pl} also provides
a server that does require the client to show its certificate. This
version provides an additional level of security, often used to allow a
selected set of clients to perform sensitive tasks.

\begin{code}
:- use_module(library(http/thread_httpd)).
:- use_module(library(http/http_ssl_plugin)).

https_server(Port, Options) :-
        http_server(reply,
                    [ port(Port),
                      ssl([ certificate_file('etc/server/server-cert.pem'),
                            key_file('etc/server/server-key.pem'),
                            password("apenoot1")
                          ])
                    | Options
                    ]).
\end{code}

Note that a single Prolog server can call http_server/2 with different
parameters to provide services at several security levels as described
below. These servers can either use their own dispatching or commonly
use http_dispatch/1 and check the \const{port} property of the request
to verify they are called with the desired security level. If a service
is approached at a too low level of security, the handler can deny
access or use HTTP redirect to send the client to to appropriate
interface.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A plain HTTP server at port 80.  This can either be used for
    non-sensitive information or for \jargon{redirecting} to a more
    secure service.
    \item An HTTPS server at port 443 for sensitive services to the
    general public.
    \item An HTTPS server that demands for a client key on a selected
    port for administrative tasks or sensitive machine-to-machine
    communication.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{HTTPS behind a proxy}
\label{sec:https-proxy}

The above expects Prolog to be accessible directly from the internet.
This is becomming more popular now that services are often deployed
using \jargon{virtualization}. If the Prolog services are placed behind
a reverse proxy, HTTPS implementation is the task of the proxy server
(e.g., Apache or Nginx). The communication from the proxy server to the
Prolog server can use either plain HTTP or HTTPS. As plain HTTP is
easier to setup and faster, this is typically preferred if the network
between the proxy server and Prolog server can be trusted.

Note that the proxy server \emph{must} decrypt the HTTPS traffic because
it must decide on the destination based on the encrypted HTTP header.
\jargon{Port forwarding} provides another option to make a server
running on a machine that is not directly connected to the internet
visible. It is not needed to decrypt the traffic using port forwarding,
but it is also not possible to realise \jargon{virtual hosts} or
\jargon{path-based} procy rules.
